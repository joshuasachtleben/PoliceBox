# PoliceBox

This is my first test project using libGDX.  It is a simple 2D game written in Java that has a primary sprite that can be controlled by the user.

I used some basic collision detection before realizing that there were libraries available to do that for me, so in future versions, I will implement that.

User can use the WASD keys to fly around.  F11 makes the app go into full-screen.  F4 displays some debug information.
